# BlackJack
A text based BlackJack game implementation.
This project is started as an assignment, But I decided to make it a real game for my kids. So, (maybe) I can implement
a QT based gui later. Thus, I design all the classes to be ready for visualization.

Simplest game may not need this number of different classes. It can be implemented more easier way, but it can not be grow up in that way.

Many players may build their strategies with the card left on the decks. Thus, counting the decks and how many cards lefts in the deck is important.
It makes the game is more realistic.
I started the game with 7 decks.

Steps:
- implement basic stuff. (done)
- add game logic (done)
    - hit and stands (done)
    - split
    - double
    - insurance
- implement console tricks.
    clean console
    game menu
    show usage
    settings menu
- implement saving games
- implement player records.
- support multi-languages for game play
