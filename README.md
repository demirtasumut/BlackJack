# BlackJack
A text based BlackJack game implementation.
This project is started as an assignment, But I decided to make it as a real game for my kids. So maybe I can implement
a QT based gui later. Thus I design all stuff to be ready to visualization.

Simplest game may not need this count of different classes. It can be implemented more easier way, but it can not be grown in that way.

Many players build their strategies with the card left on the decks. Thus, counting the decks and lefts is important.
It makes the game is real.

Steps:
- implement basic stuff.
- add game logic
    - hit and stands
    - split
    - double
    - insurance
- implement console tricks.
    clean console
    game menu
    show usage
    settings menu
- implement player records.
- implement saving games
